      <description>Sunday  Did a couple of Try Hack Me rooms.  Monday  Started some SC-900 videos. Got an Obsidian.md sync account. My Obsidian vaults are where I take my notes for studying different course material, but I still use Standard Notes for everything else. The main reason I did this is that the Obsidian platform is very intuitive for taking notes, and because it allows for the referencing of different entries by entire notes, sections, tags, etc.</description>

      <description>This week was a little different, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any large projects I took on. However, here&amp;rsquo;s a brain dump of what I did for the week:
 Started watching Network+ course videos from Mike Meyers and ITPro.TV. I&amp;rsquo;m currently not scheduling to sit the exam, however I will at some point this year. Finished the audio book version of Phillip Wylie&amp;rsquo;s and Kim Crawley&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Pentester Blueprint&amp;rdquo;. Listened to Black Hills 02/11 podcast episode.</description>

      <description>Sunday 02/06  Listened to Black Hills 02/04 podcast episode Worked on website layout more so that blog posts will be at the top instead of my crappy About me post.  Also added links to find me at the top.    Monday 02/07  Began watching the Microsoft MS-900 course from ITPro.TV. This will be the first Microsoft-specific course (as opposed to the totally-not-a-Microsoft course that A+ is) that I watch, and I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually go through a few others from Microsoft.</description>

      <description>Sometime last year, I decided that I wanted to get into information security. I have no post-high school education, my limited college education had nothing to do with computers, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the entirety of my working life in retail or warehouse work. Once I decided to make the jump, the first thing that I read was that I need to build my foundational knowledge, and that the A+ is the most basic of basic stuff that people should know.</description>

      <description>This was the final week before taking my A+ 1002 exam, so that guided the majority of my time.
Sunday 01/30  I finally took the time to get my website started! Big thanks to Graham Helton for the inspiration. I still have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing but at least I got it started.  Monday 01/31  Studied for my A+ exam. I&amp;rsquo;m watching Professor Messer videos since I already finished those from Mik Meyers and ITPro.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had blogs in the past for various reasons, including a WordPress blog for infosec that had like a grand total of three posts. I hate WordPress. So I deleted it, and made this one instead. Have fun checking this out!</description>
