      <description>This was the final week before taking my A+ 1002 exam, so that guided the majority of my time.
Sunday 01/30  I finally took the time to get my website started! Big thanks to Graham Helton for the inspiration. I still have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing but at least I got it started.  Monday 01/31  Studied for my A+ exam. I&amp;rsquo;m watching Professor Messer videos since I already finished those from Mik Meyers and ITPro.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had blogs in the past for various reasons, including a WordPress blog for infosec that had like a grand total of three posts. I hate WordPress. So I deleted it, and made this one instead. Have fun checking this out!</description>
